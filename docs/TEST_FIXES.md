# Test Fixes for Validation

**Date:** October 7, 2025  
**Issue:** Controller tests failing due to new validation rules

---

## 🐛 Problem

After adding validation annotations, some controller tests were failing because the test data was too short:

```
Field error in object 'projectRequest' on field 'name': 
rejected value [P]; 
default message [Project name must be between 3 and 100 characters]
```

---

## ✅ Fixed Tests

### ProjectControllerTest.java
**Before:**
```json
{"name":"P"}
```

**After:**
```json
{"name":"Test Project"}
```

---

### TaskControllerTest.java
**Before:**
```json
{"title":"T","priority":2,"assigneeId":8}
```

**After:**
```json
{"title":"Test Task","priority":2,"assigneeId":8}
```

---

### SprintControllerTest.java
**Before:**
```json
{"name":"S"}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "name":"Sprint 1",
  "startDate":"2025-10-01",
  "endDate":"2025-10-14"
}
```

## 🎯 Validation Requirements Met

| Field | Minimum Length | Test Value Length | ✅ |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|-----|
| Project Name | 3 chars | "Test Project" (12 chars) | ✅ |
| Task Title | 3 chars | "Test Task" (9 chars) | ✅ |
| Sprint Name | 3 chars | "Sprint 1" (8 chars) | ✅ |
| Sprint Start Date | Required | "2025-10-01" | ✅ |
| Sprint End Date | Required | "2025-10-14" | ✅ |

## ✅ All Tests Should Now Pass

Run tests to verify:
```bash
./mvnw test
```

Expected result: All tests passing ✅
