## 🎯 What's Tested

### ✅ Core Functionality
- User registration & authentication
- JWT token generation
- Organization creation on signup
- Multi-tenant isolation (organization-based access control)
- CRUD operations for all entities (Projects, Sprints, Tasks, Users)
- Filtering & querying (tasks by status, priority, assignee)
- Partial updates (only updating provided fields)

### ✅ Security
- Organization access control
- User authorization checks
- Multi-tenant data isolation
- Password encoding (BCrypt)

### ✅ Error Handling
- Not found exceptions
- Access denied exceptions
- Invalid input validation

### ✅ Business Logic
- Default task status (TO_DO)
- Sprint-project relationships
- Task-sprint-assignee relationships
- Organization-user relationships

## 🧰 Testing Tools & Frameworks

- **JUnit 5** - Test framework
- **Mockito** - Mocking framework
- **AssertJ** - Fluent assertions
- **Spring Boot Test** - Integration testing support
- **MockMvc** - Controller testing
- **@ActiveProfiles("test")** - In-memory H2 database for tests

---

## 📝 Test Configuration

### Test Database
- **Profile:** `test`
- **Database:** H2 in-memory (`jdbc:h2:mem:testdb`)
- **Config File:** `src/test/resources/application-test.properties`
- **Behavior:** Isolated database per test run, no persistence

### Production Database
- **Profile:** `default`
- **Database:** H2 file-based (`jdbc:h2:file:./data/agiledb`)
- **Config File:** `src/main/resources/application.properties`
- **Behavior:** Persistent data across restarts

---

## 🚀 Running Tests

### Run All Tests
```bash
./mvnw test
```

### Run Specific Test Class
```bash
./mvnw test -Dtest=ProjectServiceTest
```

### Run with Coverage Report
```bash
./mvnw test jacoco:report
# Report generated in: target/site/jacoco/index.html
```

### Run Tests in IDE
- Right-click on test class → "Run Tests"
- Tests use `@ActiveProfiles("test")` to load test configuration

## 📈 Next Steps for Test Improvement

### High Priority
- [ ] Add integration tests for full API workflows
- [ ] Add validation tests for DTOs
- [ ] Test error response formats
- [ ] Add security integration tests

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Add performance/load tests
- [ ] Test concurrent access scenarios
- [ ] Add database constraint tests
- [ ] Test pagination (when implemented)

### Low Priority
- [ ] Add mutation testing
- [ ] Increase code coverage to 90%+
- [ ] Add contract tests
- [ ] Add E2E tests with TestContainers

## 💡 Interview Talking Points

**Q: "Tell me about your testing strategy."**

> "I've implemented comprehensive unit tests covering all service layer business logic and authentication flows. The tests use Mockito for dependency injection and AssertJ for readable assertions. I've separated test and production configurations using Spring profiles - tests run against an in-memory H2 database for speed and isolation, while production uses a persistent file-based database."

**Q: "How do you ensure multi-tenant isolation?"**

> "Every service test verifies organization-based access control through the OrganizationService. The tests mock authorization checks and verify that users can only access resources within their organization. This is tested across all CRUD operations."

**Q: "What's your code coverage?"**

> "I have unit tests for all critical business logic including authentication, authorization, and CRUD operations. The service layer has comprehensive coverage with tests for both happy paths and error conditions. The tests follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern and use descriptive test names."

## ✅ Test Quality Indicators

- ✅ **Fast:** Tests run in seconds using in-memory database
- ✅ **Isolated:** Each test is independent with fresh mocks
- ✅ **Repeatable:** Same results every time
- ✅ **Readable:** Clear test names and AAA pattern
- ✅ **Maintainable:** Proper setup/teardown with @BeforeEach
- ✅ **Comprehensive:** Tests cover success and failure paths

**Status:** Production-ready test suite for resume/portfolio project! 🎉
